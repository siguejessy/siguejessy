<strong>Hello, I’m Jessica! 🧚🏻‍♀️👋🏼 </strong>

After years of dabbling with CSS & HTML as a hobbyist, I've officially made a full-time leap into the world of web dev 👩🏼‍💻🌐

As a former Ops wiz with expansive experience in product operations & technical support-based roles, I've professionally evolved from within rapid and broad-scaling SaaS startup companies during their culture & strategy-defining moments.

My rooted passions for empathic design, innovation, learning, and leveraging minimalistic tooling to make a monumental impact are key drivers in my day-to-day & web dev life. Also, the limitlessness of building with code... 🤩💡⚡️

I'm a lifelong committed learner eager to reach fluency in some of the coolest universal languages! 😍👩🏼‍💻 I'm super excited to become a contributing member & grow within this community.💗

🌱
