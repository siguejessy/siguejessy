👋🏼 Hello there, I’m Jessica! 🧚🏻‍♀️

Currently pivoting my careerpath from Product Operations to Software Engineering, mostly interested in Front-end development and UI Design. 
I'm a life-long committed learner eager to reach fluency in some of the coolest universal languages! 😍👩🏼‍💻

Super excited to become a contributing member & grow within this community.💗

🌱 I’m currently learning SWE fundamentals, HTML, CSS, & JS.
